# Pay with coin (.info)

This express application is a catch all directory listing of places to use cryptocurrency.

### sass
The stylesheets are currently generated in middleware on request. the `/public/css` folder is immutable and should not be modified, instead edit `/src/styles` and restart the app.

## Todo
- OG tags for unfurling
- Store images (to prevent CORS issues)
- style submit success/warning messages
- publish/verify/manage stores page

- Pagination on listing pages
- Clean up navigation
- Responsive checks for each page

- Contact form/email
- ReCaptcha for submit form
- Add donation addresses

- Setup infrastructure


Nice to have:
- Store profile page
- Donate address QR code on click

V2:
- Search
- Search (with index)
- tie in market caps for coins via API
- sort the coins by stores available

- API keys
